# Cranford Historical AR

A SwiftUI + ARKit/RealityKit + Core Location + Google Maps walking-tour MVP for Cranford, New Jersey.
Walk toward a historical site, follow AR arrows, and a large AR historical sign appears when you arrive.

> All stops shipped in this repository are **SAMPLE LOCATIONS** with **SAMPLE HISTORICAL DESCRIPTIONS**.
> Nothing in the app is a historical claim until verified content replaces `Resources/historical_stops.json`.

## Requirements

- macOS with **Xcode 16.0+** (Google Maps SDK 11.x requires it), iOS 17.0+ device for AR (the Simulator runs the map and Developer Controls but not ARKit).
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) 2.40+ — `brew install xcodegen`.
- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled and these APIs turned on: **Maps SDK for iOS**, **Routes API** (the legacy Directions API is not available to new projects; see below).

## Open, build, run (Mac)

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd CranfordHistoricalAR
cp Config/Secrets.example.xcconfig Config/Secrets.xcconfig   # then edit the keys
xcodegen generate                                             # creates CranfordHistoricalAR.xcodeproj
open CranfordHistoricalAR.xcodeproj
```

Select the `CranfordHistoricalAR` scheme, pick your iPhone, and run. Xcode resolves the Swift packages
(`GoogleMaps` 11.1.0 from `https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-maps-sdk`, and the local `Packages/TourCore`).

### Run the platform-independent tests anywhere

```bash
cd Packages/TourCore
swift test          # macOS or Linux; no Xcode needed
```

`TourCore` contains the models, JSON decoding, geo math, polyline codec, Routes API wire types,
route-progress math, route-refresh policy, proximity state machine (hysteresis), tour progress and the
walking simulator.

## API keys (never committed)

`Config/Secrets.xcconfig` is gitignored. Copy `Config/Secrets.example.xcconfig` to it and set:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Maps SDK for iOS. Restrict the key to iOS apps with bundle id `com.cranford.historicalar`. |
| `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY` | Routes API (`computeRoutes`, `travelMode: WALK`). Can be the same key during development. |
| `DIRECTIONS_PROVIDER` | `routes` (default) or `legacy` for Cloud projects that still have the Directions API enabled. |
| `ENABLE_ARCORE_GEOSPATIAL` | `0` (default). Set `1` only after enabling the ARCore package in `project.yml`. |
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` | Apple Team ID for device signing. |

The xcconfig values flow into `Info.plist` (`GoogleMapsAPIKey`, `GoogleRoutesAPIKey`, …) and are read by
`AppConfiguration`. If keys are missing the app still runs: the map shows a configuration notice and routes fall
back to clearly labeled straight-line estimates.

## Status

Built in stages (see `docs/` in the project store for the plan and build report). This README is updated as stages land.
